# tips-runtime-encoder
Repositories containing runtime encoders for TIPs-VF (obfuscated with CodeEnigma)

## About
The TIPs runtime encoder implements a proprietary sequence encoding algorithm using the Translator-Interpreter Pre-seeding (TIPs) logic (https://tips.chordexbio.com). TIPs releases obfuscated runtime ONLY. Each release has a validity period (per quarter). After expiration, users must update to the latest runtime.
